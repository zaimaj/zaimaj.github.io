       <div id="name-info">
       <p>My name is Zainab Majeed, and I am a junior at CAL majoring in psychology. 
        During my sophomore year, I became passionate about design and decided to pursue it as a hobby. 
        I also have a particular fondness for photography. Despite not being a professional photographer, 
        I plan to stick with this straightforward hobby. My digital camera is my favorite tool for capturing visually appealing scenery. 
        You will find a ton of pictures that I took with my digital camera in this photo gallery. 
        Sharing what you enjoy doing and the people you care about through photography is a terrific way to express yourself. 
        These are the exact sentiments I want these pictures to portray!  </p>
