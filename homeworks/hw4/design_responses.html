						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that color accessibility is important. Not many people make their designs for people with visual impairments. 
								Color accessibility allows those with impairments to be able to have the same experiences like others.
                                  </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the add ons about adding texture to graphs, charts, etc. which helps those with color accessibility to be able to distinguish between the colors.
							 This then makes it more inclusive because there are more options for people. </p>
