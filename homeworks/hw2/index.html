        <li> The goal of Target is to create an option to online shop, it is intended 
            for all people young, old, students, etc. The design accomplishes this by
            having all products online.
        </li>
        <li>My redesign included the idea to put sale items and popular items upfront. 
            I noticed that the website only had themed items displayed, which is valentine themed items. 
            Although purchasing those items may not be necessary for everyone.</li>

        <li>I learned that white space, or padding is very important. It allows our deisgns to breath. 
            it also helps maintain focus.
        </li>
        <li>My favorite part of this article was the way padding was explained. It related it to how 
            humans breathe and correlates it to design and how design needs space to breath as well. It articulates 
            this idea very well.
        </li>
        <li>Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you.</li>
