                            <p> I learned about the versatility of how user interface can be created. 
                                I saw many different aspects of the website. They had different transitions to unique welcome pages.

                            <p> My favorite part of the website the multiple different unique designs. 
                                It allows us to look at many other designs for inspiration. One of my favorite's was the 
                                “add to card interaction by Dannniel” </p>

                            <p> As I mentioned my favorite inspirations was the one created by Dannniel for Norde. I found this especially 
                                likable because how it was very innovative to add color to half the screen. I also enjoyed how the shoe changed color in real time.
                                 Another creative aspect was how the shoe itself changes size as you change the size.  </p>
