					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that animations show interactions between screens and direct a users attention. I also learned that when changing elements to animate, the duration of the animation should be slow to give users a chance to notice the change. However it should also be quick enough not to cause waiting and make the user impatient.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was where they talked about speed. They used animals to speed showing that a horse is at 200ms and so on. They also touched on physics law to further make their point which was easier to understand. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another. </p>
						</li>
