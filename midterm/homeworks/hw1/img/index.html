          Hello! My name is Zainab, it's pronounced as Zay-nub if that helps!
          I am a transfer student and this is my second sememster at Berkeley. So far I 
          love that we have so many different classes we can take and learn from. I hope to learn a lot from this 
          class as I am passionate about design.
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>1. I learned that we must develop our design eye by thinking we are the designer of a product. 
              I also learned that we should try to design something that solves problem. </li>
            <li>2. My favorite part of the article was how the person who wrote the article did not have a great start to design.
               It shows relatability and that others can improve too. 
            </li>
            <li>3. My favorite quote was “When I first started off in design, I sucked.”</li>
            <li>4. I rate it a 10, the article was easy-going and had good tips. 
              It also talked about first starting on design which was is nice to hear others experiences. </li>
          </ul>
