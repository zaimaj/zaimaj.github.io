          Hello! My name is Zainab, it's pronounced as Zay-nub if that helps!
          I am a transfer student and this is my second sememster at Berkeley. So far I 
          love that we have so many different classes we can take and learn from. I hope to learn a lot from this 
          class as I am passionate about design.
